  # To use source data from other datasets within the same BQ project, you can use the following config setting as an example.
  # This configuration demonstrates sourcing data from a dataset called `meshx_seed_v1`.
  # Once a source has been defined, it can be referenced from a model using the source() function.
  # To see an implementation example, refer to the `cloud_events_source_view.sql` model, which contains the code illustrating the usage of the `source()` function.
